# Monte-Carlo-methods

This project was realized during my first year of Master Degree in Advanced Mathematics at Paris-Dauphine University.
It deals with the implementations of the different Monte Carlo methods : antithetic variables, control variables, preferential sampling,... and calculation of relative algorithmic efficiencies.
